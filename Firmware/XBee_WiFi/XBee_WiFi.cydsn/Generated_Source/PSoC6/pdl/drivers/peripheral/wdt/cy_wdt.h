/**
* \defgroup group_wdt Watchdog Timer (WDT)
* \{
*
* The Watchdog Timer is a 16-bit free-running up-counter that can issue 
* interrupts and device reset if its interrupts are not handled.
* Use the Watchdog Timer for two main purposes.<br>
* The <b> First use case </b> is recovering from a CPU or firmware failure.
* A timeout period is set up in the watchdog timer, and if a timeout occurs, the
* device is reset (WRES). <br>
* The <b>Second use case</b> is to generate periodic interrupts.
*
* A "reset cause" register exists, and the firmware should check this register 
* at startup. An appropriate action can be taken if a WRES reset is detected.
*
* The user's firmware periodically resets the timeout period (clears or "feeds" 
* the watchdog) before a timeout occurs. If the firmware fails to do so, that is
* considered to be a CPU crash or a firmware failure, and the reason for a 
* device reset.
* The WDT can generate an interrupt instead of a device reset. The Interrupt 
* Service Routine (ISR) can handle the interrupt either as a periodic interrupt,
* or as an early indication of a firmware failure and respond accordingly.
*
* <b> Functional Description </b> <br>
* The WDT generates an interrupt when the count value in the counter equals the 
* configured match value.
*
* It is important that the counter is not reset on a match. When the counter 
* reaches a match value, it generates an interrupt and then keeps counting up 
* till it overflows and rolls back to zero and reaches the match value again, at
* which point another interrupt is generated.
*
* To use a WDT to generate a periodic interrupt, the match value should be 
* incremented in the ISR. As a result, the next WDT interrupt is generated when 
* the counter reaches a new match value.
*
* You can also reduce the entire WDT counter period by 
* specifying the number of most significant bits that are cut-off in the WDT 
* counter. For example, if the Cy_WDT_SetIgnoreBits() function is called with
* parameter 3, the WDT counter becomes a 13-bit free-running up-counter.
*
* <b> Power Modes </b> <br>
* WDT can operate in all possible low power modes. 
* Operation during Hibernate mode is possible because the logic and 
* high-voltage internal low oscillator (ILO) are supplied by the external 
* high-voltage supply (Vddd). The WDT can be configured to wake the device from 
* Hibernate mode.
*
* In Active or LPActive mode, an interrupt request from the WDT is sent to the 
* CPU via IRQ 22. In Sleep, LPSleep or Deep Sleep power mode, the CPU subsystem 
* is powered down, so the interrupt request from the WDT is sent directly to the
* WakeUp Interrupt Controller (WIC), which will then wake up the CPU. The 
* CPU then acknowledges the interrupt request and executes the ISR.
*
* After waking from Deep Sleep, an internal timer value is set to zero until the
* ILO loads the register with the correct value. This  can cause an increase in 
* low-power mode current consumption. The work around is to wait for the first 
* negative edge of the ILO clock before allowing the WDT_CNT register to be read
* by the Cy_WDT_GetCount() function.
*
* <b> Clock Source </b> <br>
* The WDT is clocked by the 32 kHz ILO. The WDT reset must be disabled 
* before disabling the ILO. Otherwise, any register write to disable the ILO is
* ignored. Enabling the WDT reset automatically enables the ILO.
* According to the device datasheet, the ILO accuracy is +/-30% over voltage 
* and temperature. This means that the timeout period may vary by 30% from the 
* configured value. Appropriate margins should be added while configuring WDT 
* intervals to make sure that unwanted device resets do not occur on some 
* devices.
* 
* Refer to the device datasheet for more information on the oscillator accuracy.
*
* <b> Register Locking </b> <br>
* You can prevent accidental corruption of the WDT configuration by calling 
* the Cy_WDT_Lock() function. When the WDT is locked, any writing to the WDT_*, 
* CLK_ILO_CONFIG, CLK_SELECT.LFCLK_SEL, and CLK_TRIM_ILO_CTL registers is 
* ignored.
* Call the Cy_WDT_Unlock() function to allow WDT registers modification.
*
* <b> Clearing WDT </b> <br>
* The ILO clock is asynchronous to the SysClk. As a result it generally 
* takes three ILO cycles for WDT register changes to come into effect. It is 
* important to remember that a WDT should be cleared at least four cycles 
* (3 + 1 for sure) before a timeout occurs, especially when small 
* match values / low-toggle bit numbers are used.
*
* \warning There is a risk of situations when WDT reset can be generated 
* faster than device start-up. Be aware of such situations by calculating the 
* start-up time and WDT reset time. The WDT reset time should be always smaller 
* than device start-up time.
*
* <b> Reset Detection </b> <br>
* Use the Cy_SysLib_GetResetReason() function to detect whether the WDT has 
* triggered a device reset.
*
* <b> Interrupt Configuration </b> <br>
* The Global Signal Reference and Interrupt components can be used for ISR 
* configuration. If the WDT is configured to generate an interrupt, the pending 
* interrupts must be cleared within the ISR (otherwise, the interrupt will be 
* generated continuously).
* A pending interrupt to the WDT block must be cleared by the call to the 
* Cy_WDT_ClearInterrupt() function. The call to the function will clear the 
* unhandled WDT interrupt counter.
*
* Use the WDT ISR as a timer to trigger certain actions 
* and to change a next WDT match value.
*
* Ensure that the interrupts from the WDT are passed to the CPU to avoid 
* unregistered interrupts. Unregistered WDT interrupts result in continuous 
* device reset. To avoid a continuous device reset, call 
* Cy_WDT_UnmaskInterrupt(). After that, call the WDT API functions for interrupt
* handling/clearing.
*
* \section group_wdt_configuration Configuration Considerations
*
* To start the WDT, make sure that ILO is enabled.
* After the ILO is enabled, ensure that the WDT is unlocked and disabled by calling 
* the Cy_WDT_Unlock() and Cy_WDT_Disable() functions. Set the WDT match value by
* calling Cy_WDT_SetMatch() with the required match value. If needed, set the 
* ignore bits for reducing the WDT counter period by calling Cy_WDT_SetIgnoreBits() 
* function. After the WDT configuration is set, call Cy_WDT_Enable().
*
* \note Enable a WDT if the power supply can produce
* sudden brownout events that may compromise the CPU functionality. This 
* ensures that the system can recover after a brownout.
*
* When the WDT is used to protect against system crashes, the 
* WDT interrupt should be cleared by a portion of the code that is not directly 
* associated with the WDT interrupt.
* Otherwise, it is possible that the main firmware loop has crashed or is in an 
* endless loop, but the WDT interrupt vector continues to operate and service 
* the WDT. The user should:
* * Feed the watchdog by clearing the interrupt bit regularly in the main body 
* of the firmware code.
*
* * Guarantee that the interrupt is cleared at least once every WDT period.
*
* * Use the WDT ISR only as a timer to trigger certain actions and to change the
* next match value.
