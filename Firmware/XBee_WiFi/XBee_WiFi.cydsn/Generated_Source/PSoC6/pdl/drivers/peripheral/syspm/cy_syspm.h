* Power Modes
*
* Devices support the following power modes (in the order of
* high-to-low power consumption): Active, Sleep, Low Power (LP) Active,
* LP Sleep, DeepSleep, and Hibernate.
* Active and Sleep are the standard ARM-defined power modes, supported by the
* ARM CPUs.
* DeepSleep is a lower-power mode where high-frequency clocks are disabled.
* Most of the register state is retained and the platform supports saving a
* configurable amount of the SRAM state.
* Hibernate is an even lower power mode that is entered from firmware,
* just like DeepSleep. However, on a wakeup the CPU and all peripherals go
* through a full reset.
*
* The power mode library is used to enter low-power states to reduce system
* power consumption in power sensitive designs. This library allows the user to
* individually power down each CPU into Sleep or DeepSleep.

*
* Power modes:
* * Active - In this mode the CPU executes code, and all logic and memories
* are powered. Firmware may decide to disable clocks for specific peripherals
* and to power down specific analog power domains. The chip enters Active upon
* initial reset. For internally-generated resets, the chip enters the most
* recently used power mode among Active and LPActive.
*
* * Sleep - In this mode the CPU does not execute code and its clock is
* stopped. It is identical to ACTIVE from a peripheral point of view.
*
* * LPActive - LPActive (Low Power Active) is similar to Active, with clock
* restrictions and limited/slowed peripheral to achieve a lower system current.
*
* * LPSleep - LPSleep (Low Power Sleep) mode operates the same as Sleep mode
* with the clocking limitations of LPActive mode to further reduce system power.
*
* * DeepSleep - In DeepSleep mode the main system clock is off for CPU, Flash,
* and high-speed logic. Optionally, the low frequency (32.768 kHz) clock
* remains on, and low-frequency peripherals continue operating.
* Peripherals that do not need a clock or receive a clock from their external
* interface (e.g., I2C/SPI) continue operating, and all circuits that draw
* current from the Vccdpslp supply are subject to the current sourcing
* limitations of the DeepSleep Regulator (if the core is supplied by the
* Linear core regulator). If the core is supplied by the SIMO Buck regulator all
* deepsleep peripherals are supplied by Vbuck1.
* A normal wakeup from DeepSleep returns to either LPActive, LPSleep, Active, or
* Sleep, depending on the previous state and programmed behavior for the
* configured wakeup interrupt.
* Likewise, a debug wakeup from DeepSleep returns to LPSleep or Sleep, depending
* on which mode was used to enter DeepSleep.
*
* * Hibernate - Is the lowest power mode available when external supplies are
* present. It is intended for applications in a dormant state.
* Hibernate is implemented using high voltage logic and switches off all
* internal regulators. The Backup domain continues functioning normally.
* The I/O's state is frozen so that the output driver state is held.
* Note in this mode the CPU and all peripherals lose state, so the system and
* firmware reboot on a wakeup event.
* Wakeup is supported from device specific pin(s) with programmable
* polarity. Additionally, unregulated peripherals can wake the device under
* some conditions. For example, a low-power comparator can wake the device by
* comparing two external voltages but may not support comparison to an
* internally-generated voltage. The Backup domain remains functional, and if
* present it can schedule an alarm to wake the device from Hibernate using RTC.
* The combination of Hibernate and Backup alarms can yield low current duty
* cycling for applications, such as waking once per second for a CapSense
* scan. Alternatively, the Watchdog Timer (WDT) can be configured to wake-up the device by
* WDT interrupt.
* Backup memory (BMEM) can be used to store system state for use on the
* next reboot.
* 
* The system can wakeup from Hibernate power mode by configuring:
* * Wakeup pins
* * WDT interrupt
* * LPComparator
* * WDT reset - this can be configured without using the syspm driver. Just
* configure and enable the WDT before entering Hibernate power mode. All
* other events require use of the API from the syspm driver.
*
* * XRES - is the state of the part when XRES is applied. This is obviously a
* reset condition, but it is also considered a power mode because some low-power
* applications, such as remote controls, expect very low current consumption
* when XRES is asserted.
*
* * OFF - The OFF state simply represents the state of the part with no power
* applied to it (except perhaps the Backup domain). In some applications, power
* to the device will be switched on and off  by another device in the system to
* make the product implement the lowest power consumption level.
*
* Wakeup time after a reset is device-dependent because of the boot run-time.
* The wakeup time varies depending on the number and type of trim parameters and
* the size of device Flash.
*
* For ARM-based devices, an interrupt is required for the CPU to
* wake up.
*
* * All pending interrupts should be cleared before the device is put into a
* low-power mode, even if they are masked.
*
* \section group_syspm_section_configuration Configuration Considerations
* After initial device boot the device goes into Active power mode. After some
* code execution the device could be sent into low power modes. The 
* Cy_SysPm_Sleep() and Cy_SysPm_DeepSleep() functions only switch the core that
* calls the function into Sleep or DeepSleep. To set the whole device into Sleep
* or DeepSleep device, ensure that each core calls the sleep functions.
* 
* There are situations when the device does not switch into DeepSleep power
* mode immediately after the second core calls Cy_SysPm_DeepSleep(). The device
* will switch into DeepSleep mode automatically a little bit later, after the
* low-power circuits are ready to switch into DeepSleep.
* Refer to the Cy_SysPm_DeepSleep() description for more details.
*
* If you call Cy_SysPm_Hibernate() the device will be switched
* into Hibernate power mode directly, as there is no handshake between cores.
*
* Before switching into LPActive power mode ensure that the device meets the 
* current load limitation by decreasing the Mhz clocks, and slowing or disabling
* peripherals.
* Refer to the device TRM for more details about current load limitations in
* different low-power modes.
*
* The syspm driver implements a syspm callbacks mechanism. Using a
* syspm callback, you can perform actions right before entering
* low-power mode, and directly after switching out of low-power mode. With the 
* callback mechanism you can prevent switching into low power mode if, for 
* example, some required peripheral is not ready to enter into requested 
* low-power mode.
* 
* Fill in the cy_stc_syspm_callback_t structure for each callback function. 
* Each callback function is of the type cy_SysPMCallback. You assign
* the mode for each callback function. Refer to cy_en_syspm_callback_mode_t.
* Also refer to Cy_SysPm_Sleep(), Cy_SysPm_DeepSleep(), Cy_SysPm_EnterLpMode(),
* Cy_SysPm_ExitLpMode(), Cy_SysPm_Hibernate() for more details.
*
* Refer to Cy_SysPm_RegisterCallback() description for more details
* about registering a callback. You may have up to 32 callback functions.
